<h1> Jack Northall </h1>

I'm looking for a Full Stack Junior Developer role, where I can keep furthering my knowledge. I have a passion for problem solving and logical thinking, for instance as a young teenager I loved trying to find innovative ways to work around the logic of gaming systems to increase my progress.

<h1> Skills </h1>

<h6> Communication </h6> 
I have always enjoyed playing team sports. I was captain of my Sunday league football team. A key role for the captain is to harness the different qualities within your team and get the best out of each individual through clear and concise communications. During my time as captain, our team were promoted twice and won the Surrey Youth Cup. I believe this experience stands me in good stead in a business environment.

<h6>Analysis</h6>
Studying economics at University taught me how to manipulate large datasets, break down a project in to smaller manageable tasks to ensure that they were completed on time. This experience certainly helped when completing development projects at “Makers”.

<h6> Composure </h6>
Whilst I am able to pick up new skills and technologies quickly, I think one of my best strengths is to keep a clear head when under pressure.

At “Makers” we were often give tight deadlines to produce new development projects, using newly learned coding languages and frameworks. It was essential when completing these projects to have a plan and follow it without getting stressed, in most instances the projects were being undertaken by a team of students and my sports and University experience really helped in making sure we all knew what tasks we were responsible for and to support each other if anyone fell behind so we could work successfully as a team.

<h6> Competitve </h6> 
I love challenges whether they are in sport or coding. I believe that being competitive means that you should always be looking to improve and learn new skills. I like playing against better players in sport or working with people that have different skill sets than myself as it allows me to constantly improve.

<h1>Education</h1>

Software Developer Bootcamp: Makers Academy (London, UK) 16 week program / 10% acceptance rate / “Coding the right way”.

<h1>Employment</h1>


GBK: Grill Chef: 4 months. Skills, teamwork and performing under pressure.

Started as a kitchen hand and quickly promoted Grill Chef. I learnt the importance of good team work to make sure the kitchen ran smoothly, all meals were well cooked, complete and delivered on time, in a highly pressurised environment.

Vision Accendo Ltd: Lighting Installation Apprentice; 6 Months. Skills, supporting a team of engineers to remove old lighting with latest LED technology in complex and demanding building infrastructures.

Worked nights in a variety of buildings, helping engineers install large lighting projects. The most demanding project was helping in the fit out of a complete new lighting system at The Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. This is a large listed building and we had to work around the various rehearsal and public performances that were being staged at the same time as the fit out. Working within the very specific time scales provided by the management at the Opera House and respecting the unique aspects of such an iconic building meant careful planning and 100% adherence to this plan. The work was physically demanding but completing the project on time and to the client’s requirements was very satisfying.

<h3> Interests </h3> 
My main interests are watching and playing football, playing squash and tennis, all types of online gaming and coding.
