<h1> Jack Northall </h1>

I'm looking for a Full Stack Junior Developer role, where I can keep furthering my knowledge of this industry. I have always had a passion for problem solving and understanding mechanics behind machines, this stemmed from my early introduction into gaming which is an industry I hope to move into in the future.

<h1> Skills </h1>

<h3> Communication </h3> 
I have always felt that teamwork will exceed an individuals performance, my years in various school sports team where we were always the underdogs, or the local sunday league side I previously captained all of this experience has allowed me to understand that a well built 'team' is where you have a lot of different qualities brought together by a strong leader and communicator.

<h3>Analysis</h3>
My years in economics and time at makers have enabled me to further my understanding of what is required of me for a task, breaking said task down and organising my time to acheive success. I have always enjoyed learning new things and would like this to continue in the future. I am always analysing day to day activities thinking of small changes that would improve the world I live in.

<h3> Patience </h3>
Although I am proud to say that I pick up new skills and technologies very quickly, the strongest skill you can have is patience for when it doesn't come to plan, to make decisions under pressure without panicking and to keep persevering when it doesn't go your way. This skill has become even strong with my time at makers as I can double my knowledge daily but when a problem occurs you musn't panick but use yours skills and resources to break down the problem logically and therefore the solution.

<h3>Education</h3>
Software \developer Bootcamp: Makers Academy (London, UK)
16 week program / 10% acceptance rate / Coding the right way. 

BA in Economics: Nottingham Trent University.
3 year Economics course, Technologies advancements and their effect on the economy. 

<Working History> 
GBK Grill Chef: 4 months
Skills, working in a team and learning a new industry and skills that previously escaped me, rising through the ranks quickly as i looked to improve myself and the team in the short time i was there.
Vision Accendo 
Working nights is a different place, especially in the royal opera house in covent garden, installing lights was another new industry and gave me an insight into the complications of working physically day to day along with a different side to the world i rarely seen. 

<h3> Interests </h3> 
Before makers my previous interest were football, sports in general, gaming and new technologies. Since makers it has awoken a passion for code and intertwining that with my other passions.
