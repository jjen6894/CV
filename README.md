<h1>Jack Northall</h1>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
At Nottingham University, I studied micro and macroeconomics and especially
enjoyed studying how new and emerging technologies impacted the economy.
After leaving University I considered where I wanted to develop my career. Given my
skill set and interests I felt that training as a software developer was something that
really interested me. 

I then took on a variety of jobs, regardless of what they were to
finance joining Makers Academy on their “Coding the Right Way” course. This is a
16-week boot camp where we covered a range of languages and disciplines such
as: - JavaScript, Ruby, Python, HAML, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Unit testing, Test
driven development, Best Practices and Pair-Programming.
At Makers Academy I went from a being a novice coder, using Ruby to create a
simple oyster card model to building an application from scratch within 10 weeks: -</p>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<strong>Vision Accendo: Lighting Installation Apprentice</strong>
<p>December 2015-June 2016
Here I supported a team of engineers to remove old lighting with latest LED
technology in complex and demanding building infrastructures.
Worked nights in a variety of buildings, helping engineers install large lighting
projects. The most demanding project was helping in the fit out of a complete new
lighting system at The Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. This is a large listed
building and we had to work around the various rehearsal and public performances
that were being staged at the same time as the fit out. Working within the very
specific time scales provided by the management at the Opera House and
respecting the unique aspects of such an iconic building meant careful planning and
100% adherence to this plan. The work was physically demanding but completing
the project on time and to the client’s requirements was very satisfying.</p>
<strong>GBK: Grill Chef.</strong>
<p>
June 2015 – November 2015
Started as a kitchen hand and quickly promoted Grill Chef. I learnt the importance of
good team work to make sure the kitchen ran smoothly, all meals were well cooked,
complete and delivered on time, in a high pressurised environment.</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<strong>
Communication</strong>
<p>
I have always enjoyed playing team sports. I was captain of my Sunday league
football team. Having always preffered to work as a collective I found this was excelled through my time at Makers through pair programming where communication was key in understanding the subjects we came across and making sure both coders contributed equally.</p>
<strong>
Analysis
</strong><p>
Studying Economics at University taught me how to manipulate large datasets, break
down a project in to smaller manageable tasks to ensure that they were completed
on time. This experience certainly helped when completing development projects at
“Makers”.</p>
<strong>
Competitive
</strong>
<p>
I love challenges whether they are in sport or coding. I believe that being competitive means that you should always be looking to improve and learn new skills. I like playing against better opponents in sport or working with people that have different skill
sets than myself as it allows me to constantly improve.
